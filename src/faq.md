# FAQs

- **If I flash this firmware, will I be able to revert to the original Anne Pro
firmware later?**

Yes. We use the original Anne Pro 2's bootloader to load our firmware, so
reverting is as easy as putting the keyboard into IAP mode and do an firmware
update with ObinsKit. (Note: We have noticed ObinsKit might have trouble restoring
when under macOS, but have had great success with Windows.)
